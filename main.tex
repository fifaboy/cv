\section{Projects}
\cventry{$2019$}{Machine learning, data engineering, data analysis}{Shohoz}{Python}{At Shohoz, I have been working on a data pipeline in Azure, user profiling and clustering, fraud analysis and exploratory data analysis. I have also worked on AWS based data pipeline using Kafka as message queue service.}{}
\cventry{$2019$}{Deep learning, computer vision, feature extraction, object detection}{Auleek}{Python, C++, C\#}{I used deep learning in tensorflow to extract features from floorplan images. The challenge was to find a viable solution that can detect elements such as doors, walls, windows etc and I was able to do it using object detection. There was also esh generation for different kind of object shapes, mesh combining such as union or intersection, checking if an object can be placed in an arrangement (for example with rotation) etc}{}
\cventry{$2018$}{E-veterinary, web development}{Reve systems}{Java, Spring Boot, JPA}{I worked on both backend and frontend for this government project. We used Spring boot for faster development, thymeleaf and javascript for front-end communication and JPA for hibernate-like ORM manipulation. Agile development process helped us complete the project within the tight deadline.}{Here is the live server \texttt{http://evet.gov.bd/login}}
\cventry{$2017$}{IP log, Networking, Multithreading}{Reve systems}{C++}{My job in this project was to receive and process all incoming and outgoing packets from a network interface. Multithreading was necessary to prevent packet loss.}{}
\cventry{$2016$}{Machine learning, recommender Systems, improving collaborative filtering}{Bsc Thesis}{C++, Python}{In my thesis, I developed a recommender systems with F-1 score of almost 75\%. }{}
\cventry{$2016$}{Machine learning, web development, data analysis}{Threat Equation PTE Ltd}{Python, Django}{My role in this project was to predict vulnerability from server logs after training them on previously fed data. Then I had to present the predictions and related information in the dashboard for visualization}{}
