\section{Work Experience}
\cventry{$2019$}{Senior Data Scientist, August $2019$ to present}{Shohoz}{Dhaka}{}{
	My work at Shohoz.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provided analytics, visualization modules and scalable data storage solution for Corona Tracer, a project by Shohoz and Bangladesh government. Tech stacks: \texttt{PySpark, Cassandra, Bokeh, Pandas, Holoviews}, etc. This project is live at \texttt{http://tracer-admin.shohoz.com/}
		\item Built data pipelines in AWS, Azure (\texttt{python}) using message queue services such as Service bus/Event Hub/Kafka or machine learning pipeline services.
		\item Hands on exploratory data analysis of real user data using tools such as \texttt{pandas, PySpark, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow}, etc.
		\item Developed some fraud detection services e.g. automated syndicate detection in ride sharing.
		\item Developed an automated user profiling system for quest planning.
		\item Developed automated priority dispatching services.
		\item Improved upon clustering algorithm \texttt{kmeans++} for using on real data.
		\item Used data mining techniques for provider distribution/trend analysis/recommendation.
		\item Sprint/Kanban based agile development cycle on Jira/Azure DevOps.
